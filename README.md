# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using JavaScript and APIs to map earthquake data


# Summary
This was a fun project using JavaScript to map earthquake data. It was also a lesson in using branches here on GitHub so if you notice random branches, it was a learning process.
Using Mapbox, data from the USGS(https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), and tectonic data(https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates), I was able to 
create a moderately interactive map with different styles of maps. I'll let the data speak for itself.

The finished project is in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.
Note: While most scales are a gradient of a color, I am colorblind and require colors that don't look the same. That is the reason for the color choices.
